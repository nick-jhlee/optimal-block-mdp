# Running the code

Make a directory called ./data/ from here. This will be where the
files generated by the experiment script will appear.

The entry file is Experiments.py. This file takes a number of
arguments, such as algorithm, environment, environment parameters,
number of episodes, and any algorithm hyperparameters, conducts a
simulation, and writes the running average reward into a file in the
./data directory. Please see that file for details on arguments.

Hyperparameter configurations used for sweeping are in Params.py. You
may use this as follows:

```
import Params
for s in Parameters['Lock-v0']['oracleq']:
    P = Params.Params(s)
    P.iteration = 1
    print("python3 -W ignore Experiment.py %s" % (P.get_params_string()))
```

This code snippet will print all commands for the first replicate
(iteration = 1) of OracleQ on Lock-Bernoulli.

Scripts for postprocessing and plotting data are contained in
Postprocess.py, PlotAll.py, PlotSensitivity.py and GetSlopes.py
